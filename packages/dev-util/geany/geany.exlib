SUMMARY="A small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment"
DESCRIPTION="
Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment. It was developed to provide a
small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as
independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME - Geany only requires
the GTK2 runtime libraries
