SUMMARY="HTTP proxying tools for WSGI apps"
DESCRIPTION="
WSGIProxy gives tools to proxy arbitrary(ish) WSGI requests to other processes over HTTP.

This will encode the WSGI request CGI-style environmental variables (which must be strings),
plus a configurable set of other variables. It also sends values like HTTP_HOST and
wsgi.url_scheme which are often obscured by the proxying process, as well as values like
SCRIPT_NAME. On the receiving end, a WSGI middleware fixes up the environment to represent
the state of the original request. This makes HTTP more like FastCGI or SCGI, which naturally
preserve these values.
