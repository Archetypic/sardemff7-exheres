SUMMARY="Bindings for the scrypt key derivation function library"
DESCRIPTION="
Scrypt is useful when encrypting password as it is possible to specify a minimum amount of time to
use when encrypting and decrypting. If, for example, a password takes 0.05 seconds to verify, a user
won't notice the slight delay when signing in, but doing a brute force search of several billion
passwords will take a considerable amount of time. This is in contrast to more traditional hash
functions such as MD5 or the SHA family which can be implemented extremely fast on cheap hardware.
